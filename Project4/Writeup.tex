\section{Usage Instructions}
    For candidate selection, I wrote a script with various parameters to experiment with.  
    The tool is self-documented sufficiently: \\
    \texttt{python filter.py -h | tee Usage.out}
    \lstinputlisting[basicstyle=\scriptsize\ttfamily]{Usage.out}
    
\section{Candidate Selection}
    Since we are working with files that do not fit in memory, 
        I used the ``generator'' pattern in Python to keep memory utilization at a minimum.
    I planned to first parse the SAM file and filter out the most obvious non-candidates:
        near perfect matches (3 or more mismatches) 
        and sequences without a significant poly-A tail (at least 3 A's). 
    I made the filter for poly-A tails very lenient, 
        in that it also counts the letters R, W, M, D, H, V, and N
        as part of the tail.  
    These are, as part of IUPAC standard nucleotide notation, possible A's.
    (\textbf{Extra credit:} The poly-A tail filter also includes a poly-T head filter for reverse complements.)
    I would then output that result in a JSON file, 
        which could be piped back into the same program for further filtering.
        
    The following command was run for this step: \\
    \texttt{python filter.py --min\_mismatch 3 --min\_polyAlen 3 --compute\_background \\
            00-01-background.json --verbose all.sam 00-01-MMM3-MPA3.json | tee 00-01-MMM3-MPA3.out}
    
    With the following output:
    \lstinputlisting[basicstyle=\small\ttfamily]{00-01-MMM3-MPA3.out}
    
    Even though this filter was very generous, it conserved about 1 in 230 sequences, 
        leaving a very manageable number of data points.  
    From here, more stringent filters can be applied within a reasonable amount of time.
