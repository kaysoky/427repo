\section{Candidate Selection (and usage instructions)}
    Since we are working with files that do not fit in memory, 
        I used the ``generator'' pattern in Python to keep memory utilization at a minimum.
    I planned to first parse the SAM file and filter out the most obvious non-candidates:
        perfect matches and sequences without a significant poly-A tail.
    I would then output that result in a JSON file, 
        which could be piped back into the same program for further filtering.
    The following command was run for this step: \\
    \texttt{python filter.py --min\_mismatch 3 --min\_polyAlen 3 --verbose all.sam \\
            01-MMM3-MPA3.json | tee 01-MMM3-MPA3.out}
    
    With the following output: \\
    % \lstinputlisting[basicstyle=\small\ttfamily]{01-MMM3-MPA3.out}
