\section{Build Instructions}
    A single iteration of the program is run with: \\
    \texttt{python viterbi.py TestViterbi.fna --inE Emission00.json --inT Transition00.json --outE Emission01.json --outT Transition01.json} \\
    
    \noindent Multiple iterations are comprised of using the output from the previous call: \\
    \texttt{python viterbi.py TestViterbi.fna --inE Emission01.json --inT Transition01.json --outE Emission02.json --outT Transition02.json} \\
    \texttt{python viterbi.py TestViterbi.fna --inE Emission02.json --inT Transition02.json --outE Emission03.json --outT Transition03.json} \\
    \texttt{...} \\
    
    \noindent The script used to run the 10 iterations is included as ``Iterate10.bat''.
    
\section{(Super slow) Computer Specs}
    1.3 GHz dual-core (my implementation is single threaded) \\
    800 MHz front side bus \\
    4 GB RAM \\
    Standard hard disk (not solid state)
    
\section{Format of iterations}
    For all iterations, I have included the parameters in JSON format.
    The emission probability matrix contains one upper level key to represent the state
        and a lower level key to represent the emitted letter.
    The transition probability matrix contains one upper level key to represent the starting state
        and a lower level key to present to the following state.  \\
    The low-GC state is state ``0''
        and the high-GC state is state ``1''.

\section{Comments}
    Since I was programming on a relatively slow computer (see computer specs), 
        I tested my algorithm with a much smaller file (1500 bases long).  
    This file was made by taking 1000 bases from the ``NC\_000909.fna'' file
        and inserting 500 bases worth of high GC content in the middle.
    (Comments are also included in the test file.)
    Originally, the middle section only had G's and C's, 
        but since that resulted in a 0 probability of A's and T's, 
        it wouldn't fit into log-space. 
    I had to pad the middle with a few A's and T's to proceed.
