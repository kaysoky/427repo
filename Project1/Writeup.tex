    The algorithm is implemented in ``align.py''.  
    It is called from either the commandline (see ``Compare.bat'') 
        or from the Python shell (see ``compare\_proteins.py'').
    
    The results for comparing ``deadly'' to ``ddgearlyk'' can be found in (``AB.out'')
    and are included in this write-up for convenience:
    \lstinputlisting[basicstyle=\ttfamily]{AB.out}

    The results for each protein pair comparison can be found in ``Proteins.out''
